# Project 3 for the SSRTWG investingating the incorporation of environmental covariates into WHAM recruitment models.

1. Create dataframes that have AIC info and convergence info: run **AIC_dataframe.R** to produce
   + *AIC_all.RDS* contains AIC and convergence info for the best EM only (lowest AIC) per OM-Sim
   + *AIC_weight.RDS* contains AIC, convergence, model rank, model weight, model probability info for all EMs per OM-Sim
  
2. Specify convergence tolerances/thresholds in **convergence_summaries.R**
   + bad.grad.value : cut-off for identifying parameters with abs(gradient)>bad.grad.value (parameter with max value and 2nd max value as well as parameter name are saved, not *all* parameters in this category)
   + bad.se.value : cut-off for identifying parameter where SE_par_max>bad.se.value (parameter with max value and 2nd max value as well as parameter name are saved, not *all* parameters in this category)
   + given this, output is produced using bad.grad.value and bad.se.value appended to plot and table names to identify the tolerances
     + plots of number of bad models (from the best set, and from all EMs per OM-Sim)
     + plots of parameters that failed the bad.grad or bad.se criteria
    
3. Generate regression trees to characterize factors influencing model identifiability; run **AIC_regression.R**
   + ...
   
4. Look at bias in SSB, Recr, Fbar
   + ...

5. Look at bias in SR_a, SR_b, sigmaR, rho_R, sigmaEcov, rho_Ecov
   + ...

<!-- When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). -->

<!-- The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed. -->
