# Growth

This repo contains code to run a simulation test for time-varying growth in WHAM. It uses the 'growth' branch of WHAM which contains some new additions required for these models. We based the simulation off the Ecov_M repo, modifying as little as necessary. Please see the README files for the other repos for more information on the setup. 

A draft writeup can be found online [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RXnyJqSyxeWxtkjTQ1H-HrqfZ2PwO7qB/edit) with further details.

To rerun the simulation execute the `code/run_ems.R` script after installing the necessary R packages and WHAM version.
