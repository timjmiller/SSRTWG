# Catchability simulation files

## Code
| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Catchability_ecov_sims.Rmd | Main script & documentation for simulation setup and result processing |
| combinePerfMet.R | Function to combine post-processed performance metric files |
| fitTree.R | Function to fit regression tree to ID settings that strongly impact simulation results |
| make_om.R | Function to set up OM |
| parallel_sims.R | Copy of simulation setup code that can be run on virtual machine with parallel runs |
| parallel_sims_EM.R | Copy of simulation code run in parallel, fit OMs to all 4 EMs, parallelize over simulations |
| parallel_sims_initEM.R | Copy of simulation code run in parallel, change initialization of EMs so not provided process or beta parameters, otherwise match parallel_sims_testEcov subset. These are the sims to use in selecting beta and observation errors to evaluate over all OMs |
| parallel_sims_OMupdate.R | Copy of simulation code run in parallel with increasing mean environmental covariate, parallelize over simulations |
| parallel_sims_qMiss.R | Copy of simulation code run in parallel with range of seasonal misspecifications implemented in EMs. Also contains post-processing for SSRTWG working papers and presentations, corresponding results available in "Results" folder on Google Drive. |
| parallel_sims_testEcov.R | Copy of simulation code run in parallel to test a subset of OMs with 1) larger range of Ecov beta parameters and 2) range of ecov observation sigmas including an option that has the OM track observations closely. |
| parallel_sims_testEcovTrend.R | Copy of simulation code run in parallel to run same tests as testEcov option but change observed trend to have higher contrast (increase from 0-100 here, testEcov increased from 0 to 5) |
| plotResults.R | Function to generate plots |
| postprocess_simTestWHAM.R | Function to post-process results and calculate performance metrics |
| Setup_OMs.Rmd | Outline OMs |
| simOM.R | Function to simulate OM data |
| simTestWHAM.R | Function to fit EMs to simulated OM data |

# RT results materials and notes
SSRTWG working paper and presentation results available in the following files/folders. Simulations with only 1 season misspecified did not implement environmental effects in both seasons correctly so those results not considered. OM simulated environmental covariate so no trend in covariate
