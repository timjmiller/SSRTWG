//current approach for NAA_om sims on UMass hpcc. 
//bash script (naa_om_hpcc_bash_x_x.sh) which includes necessary modules and Runs Rscript --vanilla Project_0\code\naa_om_hpcc_script.r start end n_cores
//The bash script provides the start and end simulation numbers and the number of cores to use (3 arguments passed)
//So at a minimum each job submission will do a minimum of 480 fits (20 ems x 24 oms x 1 sim)
//naa_om_hpcc_script loads wham and snowfall and calls run_hpcc_jobs (in Project_0\code\sim_management.R)
//run_hpcc_jobs will run separate calls of Rscript --vanilla naa_om_sim_fit_script.R for each om,em,sim and write uniquely named RDS files with any results.
//The saved RDS file is a list with length = number of ems and the element corresponding to the em being fit is possibly filled with results.
//All other list elements will be NULL as will the slot for the em if the model causes R to abort.
//This approach could be extended by specifying oms and ems to fit in a text file that is read in.
