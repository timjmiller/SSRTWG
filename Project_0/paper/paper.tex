\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Application of state-space models in fisheries stock assessment and
management has expanded dramatically within ICES, Canada and the
Northeast US \citep{nielsenberg14,cadigan16,stockmiller21}.

Much is known about the reliability of state-space models that are
linear or Gaussian \citep{aeberhardetal18}, but applications in
fisheries management are nonlinear and typically include multiple types
of observations with varying distributional assumptions. We know
relatively little about the statistical reliability of such models.
Also, there is a wide range of potential random effects structures in
assessment models and we know little about the ability of information
criteria to distinguish among such alternative structures.

But those studies focus primarily on Gaussian linear models. review
literature on reliability of hidden/latent process models. Primarily in
other fields.

Convergence results can be useful for understanding how bad convergence
in applications to real data might direct the practitioner to which
alternative random effects configurations is be more appropriate. The
type of convergence that we might use as a diagnostic is important. And
what rule of thumb we use for certain criteria e.g.~1e-6? large SEs/CVs?

Here we conduct a simulation study with operating models varying by
degree of observation error uncertainty, sources of process error (M,
NAA, q, sel), and fishing history. The simulations from these operating
models are fitted with estimating models that make alternative
assumptions for sources of process error (M, NAA\textless{} q, sel),
whether a stock-recruit model was estimated, and whether M is estimated.
We evaluate whether AIC can correctly determine the correct source of
process error and stock effects on recruitment. We also evaluate the
degree of bias in the outputs of the assessment model that are important
for management.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

Used the WHAM package \citep[][commit 77bbd94]{stockmiller21} (Miller
and Stock 2020). This packages has also been used to configure operating
and estimating models for closed loop simulations evaluating index-based
assessment methods \citep{legaultetalinpress} and is used for management
of haddock, butterfish, plaice, bluefish in the Northeast US.

We completed a simulation study with a number of operating models that
can be categorized based on where random effects are assumed: abundance
at age, natural mortality, fleet selectivity, or index catchability. For
each operating model assumptions about variance of process errors and
observations are required and the values we used were based on a review
of the range of estimates from recent applications of WHAM in management
of stocks of haddock, butterfish, and American plaice in the NE US.

We simulated 100 data sets for each operating model. For each simulated
data from each operating model we fit a set of estimating models.

Y estimating models fit to each

\hypertarget{operating-models}{%
\subsection{Operating models}\label{operating-models}}

common to all:\\
ages = 1 to 10+, M maturity

marginal standard deviations for random effects are defined in tables of
operating models.

\hypertarget{population}{%
\subsubsection{Population}\label{population}}

There are 10 age classes: ages 1 to 10+.

Spawning was assumed to occur 1/4 of the way through the year.

Natural mortality rate was assumed 0.2 when it was constant and the mean
of the time series process for operating models with M random effects.
maturity a50 = 2.89, slope = 0.88

Weight at age was generated with a LVB growth \[
L_a = L_{\infty}\left(1 - e^{-k(a - t_0)}\right)
\] where \(t_0 = 0\), \(L_\infty = 85\), and \(k = 0.3\), and a L-W
relationship such that \[
W_a = \theta_1 L_a^{\theta_2}
\] where \(\theta_1 = e^{-12.1}\) and \(\theta_2 = 3.2\).

We assumed a Beverton-Holt stock recruit function with constant
pre-recruit mortality parameters for all operating models. All
post-recruit productivity components are constant in the NAA and survey
catchability process error operating models. Therefore steepness and
unfished recruitment are also constant over the time period for those
operating models (Miller and Brooks 2021). We specified unfished
recruitment = \(R_0 = e^{10}\) and \(F_{\text{MSY}} = F_{40} = 0.348\)
equated to a steepness of 0.69 and \(\alpha=0.60\) and
\(\beta = 2.4 \times 10^{-5}\) for the \[
N_{1,y} = \frac{\alpha \text{SSB}_{y-1}}{1 + \beta \text{SSB}_{y-1}} 
\] Beverton-Holt parameterization.

The magnitude of the overfishing assumptions is based on average
estimates of overfishing for NE groundfish stocks from Wiedenmann et
al.~(20XX). Legault et al.~(2023) also used similar approaches to
defining fishing mortality histories for operating models.

Currenlty, initial population is configured at the equilibrium
distribution fishing at \(F = 2.5\times F_{\text{MSY}}\).

Initial population was configured at the equilibrium distribution
fishing at either \(F = 2.5\times F_{\text{MSY}}\) or
\(F = F_{\text{MSY}}\) for the two alternative fishing histories. That
is for a deterministic model, the age composition would not change over
time when the fishing mortality was constant at the respective level.

For operating models with time-varying random effects for M, steepness
is not constant, but we used the same alpha and beta parameters as other
operating models this equates to a steepness and R0 at the mean of the
time series process for M. For operating models with time-varying random
effects for fishery selectivity, Fmsy is also not constant however we
use the same F history as other operating models which corresponds to
Fmsy at the mean selectivity parameters.

\hypertarget{fleets}{%
\subsubsection{Fleets}\label{fleets}}

We assumed a single fleet operating year round for catch observations
with logistic selectivity for the fleet with \(a_{50} = 5\) and slope =
1. This selectivity is was used to define \(F_{\text{MSY}}\) for the
Beverton-Holt stock recruitment parameters above. We assumed a
logistic-normal distribution for the age-composition observations for
the fleet.

\hypertarget{fishing-histories}{%
\subsubsection{Fishing histories}\label{fishing-histories}}

All operating models assumed one of two different fishing histories. One
: Fishing mortality is equal to Fmsy (0.348) for the whole 40 year
period. Two : Fishing mortality is 2.5 times Fmsy for the first 20 years
then changes to Fmsy for the last 20 years.

\hypertarget{indices}{%
\subsubsection{Indices}\label{indices}}

Two time series of surveys are assumed and observed in numbers rather
than biomass for the entire 40 year period with one occurring in the
spring (0.25 way through the year) and one in the fall (0.75 way through
the year). Actually we have it currently configured that both occur 0.5
way through the year. Catchability of both surveys are assumed to be
0.1. We assumed logistic selectivity for both indices with
\(a_{50} = 5\) and slope = 1. We assumed a logistic-normal distribution
for the age-composition observations.

\hypertarget{observation-uncertainty}{%
\subsubsection{Observation Uncertainty}\label{observation-uncertainty}}

Standard deviation for log-aggregate catch was 0.1. There were two
levels of observation error variance for indices and age composition for
both indices and fleet catch. A low uncertainty specification assumed
standard deviation of both series of log-aggregate index observations
was 0.1 and the standard deviation of the logistic-normal for age
composition observations was 0.3 In the high uncertainty specification
the standard deviation for log-aggregate indices was 0.4 and that for
the age composition observations was 1.5. For all estimating models,
standard deviation for log-aggregate observations was assumed known
whereas that for the logistic-normal age composition observations was
estimated.

Probability of convergence was better for models that assumed the
correct source of process error, assumed M was known, and did not assume
stock-recruit relationships.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

The estimating models assumed variances of aggregate catch and index
observations was known. This approximation may be appropriate for
indices where we have a reliable estimate of uncertainty based on the
survey design (), but there may be better approaches for the aggregate
catch such as an informed prior on the standard errors with realistic
bounds.
