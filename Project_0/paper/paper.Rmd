# Introduction  

# Methods

We completed a simulation study with 24 NAA re operating models, 16 M re operating models, X Sel re operating models and Y q re operating models. 
We simulated N data sets for each operating model.
For each simulated data from each operating model we fit a set of estimating models.

Y estimating models fit to each

All post-recruit productivity components are constant in the NAA and survey catchability process error operating models and we set stock-recruit parameters such that unfished recruitment = exp(10) and

## Estimating models

32 estimating models
1-20 fit to each NAA RE operating model
5-24 fit to each M RE operating model
5-20,25-28 to each sel RE operating model
5-20, 29-32 to each q RE operating model

NAA_re
Random effects on Recruitment only or random effects on recruitment and transitions among older numbers at age.

M_re
Random effects on Recruitment only, M constant across age .

sel_re
Random effects on Recruitment only, fleet logistic selectivity RE model?
