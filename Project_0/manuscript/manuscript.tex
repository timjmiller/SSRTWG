Random effects can be included in state-space assessment models on many
processes and in many ways, and guidance is needed on statistical
reliability and model selection criteria. We simulated 72 operating
models with varying fishing history, observation error uncertainty, and
process error magnitude, correlation, and source (recruitment, survival,
fishery selectivity, catchability, and natural mortality). We fit
estimating models with different assumptions on the process error
source, whether (mean) natural mortality was estimated, and whether a
stock-recruit relationship was estimated.

Models that assumed the correct process error source had high
convergence and low bias. Bias was also low under most process error
assumptions when there was contrast in fishing pressure.
Stock-recruitment parameters were only reliably estimated in ideal
situations. Marginal AIC most accurately distinguished process errors on
recruitment, survival, and selectivity, as well as larger magnitude
process errors of other types. Retrospective patterns were generally
weak except for recruitment when observation error was high, even with
the correct process error assumptions. When models did exhibit some
retrospective pattern, estimating natural mortality often removed it.

\section*{Introduction}\label{introduction}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

Application of state-space models in fisheries stock assessment and
management has expanded dramatically within ICES, Canada, and the
Northeast US (Nielsen and Berg 2014; Cadigan 2016; Pedersen and Berg
2017; Stock and Miller 2021). State-space approaches that use random
effects to parameterize process errors is considered best practice and a
requirement for the next generation of stock assessment models (Hoyle et
al. 2022; Punt 2023).

Much is known about the reliability of state-space models that are
linear or Gaussian (Aeberhard et al. 2018), but applications in
fisheries management are nonlinear and typically include multiple types
of observations with varying distributional assumptions. Furthermore,
there is a wide range of potential random effects structures and model
parameters that can be treated as random effects in assessment models.
We know relatively little about the factors affecting statistical
reliability of such models or the ability of information criteria to
distinguish among such alternative structures.

Li et al. (2024) investigated some aspects of inferences for operating
models with multiple sources of process error, but there are differences
for this paper.

Here we conduct a simulation study with operating models (OMs) varying
by degree of observation error uncertainty, source and variability of
process error, and fishing history. The simulations from these OMs are
fitted with estimation models (EMs) that make alternative assumptions
for sources of process error, whether a stock-recruit model was
estimated, and whether M is estimated. We evaluate whether AIC can
correctly determine the correct source of process error and stock
effects on recruitment. We also evaluate the degree of bias in the
outputs of the assessment model that are important for management.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section*{Methods}\label{methods}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Methods}

We used the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM) to configure operating
and EMs in our simulation study (Miller and Stock 2020; Stock and Miller
2021). WHAM is an R package freely available as a github repository. For
this study we used
\href{https://github.com/timjmiller/wham/tree/77bbd946e4881216a439933473d1c58b21c270c3}{version
1.0.6.9000, commit 77bbd94}. This package has also been used to
configure operating and EMs for closed loop simulations evaluating
index-based assessment methods (Legault et al. 2023) and is used for
management of haddock, butterfish, American plaice, bluefish, Atlantic
cod, black sea bass, and yellowtail flounder in the Northeast US.

We completed a simulation study with a number of OMs that can be
categorized based on where process error random effects are assumed:
abundance at age (R, R+S), natural mortality (R+M), fleet selectivity
(R+Sel), or index catchability (R+q). For each OM assumption about
variance of process errors and observations are required and the values
we used were based on a review of the range of estimates from
applications of WHAM in management of stocks of haddock, butterfish, and
American plaice in the NE US.

In total, we configured 72 OMs with alternative assumptions about the
source and variability of process errors, level of observation error in
indices and age composition data, and contrast in fishing pressure over
time. We fitted 20 EMs to observations from each of 100 simulations
where process errors were also simulated. EMs made alternative
assumptions about the source of process errors and whether natural
mortality (or the mean for models with process error in natural
mortality) was estimated and whether a Beverton-Holt stock recruit
relationship was estimated within the EM. Details of each of the
operating and EMs are described below.

We did not use the log-normal bias-correction feature for process errors
or observations described by (Stock and Miller 2021) for operating and
EMs (Li et al. In review). Simulations and model fitting were all
carried out on the University of Massachusetts Green High-Performance
Computing Cluster. All code we used to perform the simulation study and
summarize results can be found at

\hypertarget{population}{%
\subsubsection*{Population}\label{population}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Population}

The population consists of 10 age classes: ages 1 to 10+ and we assume
spawning occurs each year 1/4 of the way through the year. The maturity
at age was a logistic curve with \(a_{50}\) = 2.89 and slope = 0.88
(Figure \ref{om_maturity}).

Weight at age was generated with a von Bertalanffy growth function \[
L_a = L_{\infty}\left(1 - e^{-k(a - t_0)}\right)
\] where \(t_0 = 0\), \(L_\infty = 85\), and \(k = 0.3\), and a L-W
relationship such that \[
W_a = \theta_1 L_a^{\theta_2}
\] where \(\theta_1 = e^{-12.1}\) and \(\theta_2 = 3.2\) (Figure
\ref{om_waa}).

We assumed a Beverton-Holt stock recruit function with constant
pre-recruit mortality parameters for all OMs. All post-recruit
productivity components are constant in the NAA and survey catchability
process error OMs. Therefore steepness and unfished recruitment are also
constant over the time period for those OMs (Miller and Brooks 2021). We
specified unfished recruitment = \(R_0 = e^{10}\) and
\(\Fmsy = F_{40\%} = 0.348\) equated to a steepness of 0.69 and
\(\alpha=0.60\) and \(\beta = 2.4 \times 10^{-5}\) for the \[
N_{1,y} = \frac{\alpha \text{SSB}_{y-1}}{1 + \beta \text{SSB}_{y-1}} 
\] Beverton-Holt parameterization (Figure \ref{om_sr}). For OMs without
process errors on natural mortality we assumed the rate was assumed 0.2.
For OMs with process errors on natural mortality the mean log natural
mortality rate was \(\log(0.2)\).

We used two fishing scenarios for OMs. In the first scenario, the stock
experiences overfishing at 2.5\Fmsy for the first 20 years and fishing
at \Fmsy for the last 20 years (denoted \(2.5\Fmsy \rightarrow \Fmsy\)).
In the second scenario, the stock is fished at \Fmsy for the entire time
period. The magnitude of the overfishing assumptions is based on average
estimates of overfishing for NE groundfish stocks from (Wiedenmann et
al. 2019). Legault et al. (2023) also used similar approaches to
defining fishing mortality histories for OMs.

We specified initial population abundance at age at the equilibrium
distribution fishing at either \(F = 2.5\times \Fmsy\) or \(F = \Fmsy\)
for the two alternative fishing histories. This implies that, for a
deterministic model, the abundance at age would not change from the
first year to the next.

For OMs with time-varying random effects for M, steepness is not
constant, but we used the same alpha and beta parameters as other OMs
this equates to a steepness and R0 at the median of the time series
process for M. For OMs with time-varying random effects for fishery
selectivity, \Fmsy is also not constant however we use the same F
history as other OMs which corresponds to Fmsy at the mean selectivity
parameters.

\hypertarget{fleets}{%
\subsubsection*{Fleets}\label{fleets}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Fleets}

We assumed a single fleet operating year round for catch observations
with logistic selectivity for the fleet with \(a_{50} = 5\) and slope =
1 (Figure \ref{om_mean_selectivity}). This selectivity is was used to
define \Fmsy for the Beverton-Holt stock recruitment parameters above.
We assumed a logistic-normal distribution for the age-composition
observations for the fleet.

\hypertarget{indices}{%
\subsubsection*{Indices}\label{indices}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Indices}

Two time series of surveys are assumed and observed in numbers rather
than biomass for the entire 40 year period with one occurring in the
spring (0.25 of each year) and one in the fall (0.75 of each year).
Catchability of both surveys are assumed to be 0.1. Like the fishing
fleet, we assumed logistic selectivity for both indices with
\(a_{50} = 5\) and slope = 1 and a logistic-normal distribution for the
age-composition observations.

\hypertarget{observation-uncertainty}{%
\subsubsection*{Observation Uncertainty}\label{observation-uncertainty}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Observation Uncertainty}

Standard deviation for log-aggregate catch was 0.1. There were two
levels of observation error variance for indices and age composition for
both indices and fleet catch. A low uncertainty specification assumed
standard deviation of both series of log-aggregate index observations
was 0.1 and the standard deviation of the logistic-normal for age
composition observations was 0.3 In the high uncertainty specification
the standard deviation for log-aggregate indices was 0.4 and that for
the age composition observations was 1.5. For all EMs, standard
deviation for log-aggregate observations was assumed known whereas that
for the logistic-normal age composition observations was estimated.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Operating models with random
effects on numbers at age}

For operating models with random effects on recruitment and(or) survival
(R, R+S) we assumed marginal standard deviations for recruitment of
\(\sigma_R \in \{0.5,1.5\}\) and marginal standard deviations for older
age classes of \(\sigma_{2+} \in \{0,0.25, 0.5\}\). The full factorial
combination of these process error assumptions and fishing history (2
levels) and observation error (2 levels) scenarios described above
results in 24 different R (\(\sigma_{2+} = 0\)) and R+S operating models
(Table \ref{naa_om_table}).

\subsubsection*{Operating models with random effects on natural
mortality}\label{operating-models-with-random-effects-on-natural-mortality}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Operating models with random
effects on natural mortality}

All R+M OMs treat natural mortality constant across age, but with
annually varying random effects. WHAM treats natural mortality as a
log-transformed parameter \[
\log M_{y,a} = \mu_{M} + \epsilon_{M,y}
\] that is a linear combination of a mean that is constant across ages
\(\mu_{M} = \log(0.2)\) and any annual random effects marginally
distributed as
\(\epsilon_{M,y} \sim \text{N}\left(0,\sigma_M^2\right)\). Uncorrelated
random effects were also included on recruitment with \(\sigma_R = 0.5\)
(hence, R+M). The marginal standard deviations we assumed for log
natural mortality random effects were \(\sigma_M \in \{0.1, 0.5\}\) and
AR1 autocorrelation parameters of \(\rho_M \in \{0,0.9\}\). The full
factorial combination of these process error assumptions and fishing
history (2 levels) and observation error (2 levels) scenarios described
above results in 16 different R+M OMs (Table \ref{M_om_table}).

MORE SPECIFICS about correlation of random effects? Both selectivity
pars? just correlated by year? WHAM treats selectivity parameter \(s\)
as a logit-transformed parameter \[
\log\left(\frac{p_{s,y}-l_{s}}{u_{s}-p_{s,y}}\right) = \mu_s + \epsilon_{s,y}
\] that is a linear combination of a mean \(\mu_s\) and any annual
random effects marginally distributed as
\(\epsilon_{s,y} \sim \text{N}\left(0,\sigma_s^2\right)\) where the
lower and upper bounds of the parameter (\(l_s\) and \(u_s\)) can be
specified by the user. All selectivity parameters are either \(a_50\) or
slope parameters and we assume bounds of 0 and 10 for all selectivity
parameters for all operating and EMs. The marginal standard deviations
we assumed for logit scale random effects were
\(\sigma_s \in \{0.1, 0.5\}\) and AR1 autocorrelation parameters of
\(\rho_s \in \{0,0.9\}\). Like R+M OMs, the full factorial combination
of these process error assumptions and fishing history (2 levels) and
observation error (2 levels) scenarios described above results in 16
different R+Sel OMs (Table \ref{sel_om_table}).

\subsubsection*{Operating models with random effects on index
catchability}\label{operating-models-with-random-effects-on-index-catchability}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Operating models with random
effects on index catchability}

Like selectivity parameters, WHAM treats catchability for an index \(i\)
as a logit-transformed parameter \[
\log\left(\frac{q_{i,y}-l_{i}}{u_{i}-q_{i,y}}\right) = \mu_i + \epsilon_{i,y}
\] that is a linear combination of a mean \(\mu_i\) and any annual
random effects marginally distributed as
\(\epsilon_{i,y} \sim \text{N}\left(0,\sigma_i^2\right)\) where the
lower and upper bounds of the catchability (\(l_i\) and \(u_i\)) can be
specified by the user. Here we assume bounds of 0 and 1000 for all
operating and EMs. For operating and EMs with process errors on
catchability, the temporal variation is only assumed for the first
index. The marginal standard deviations we assumed for logit scale
random effects were \(\sigma_i \in \{0.1, 0.5\}\) and AR1
autocorrelation parameters of \(\rho_i \in \{0,0.9\}\). Like R+M and
R+Sel OMs, the full factorial combination of these process error
assumptions and fishing history (2 levels) and observation error (2
levels) scenarios described above results in 16 different R+q OMs (Table
\ref{q_om_table}).

For each data set simulated from an OM 20 EMs were fit. A total of 32
different EMs were fit across all OMs where the subset of 20 depended on
the source of process error (Table \ref{em_table}). The first 20 EMs in
Table \ref{em_table} were fit to simulate data sets from R and R+S OMs.
EMs 5 to 24 in Table \ref{em_table} were fit to simulate data sets from
R+M OMs. EMs 5 to 20 and 25-28 in Table \ref{em_table} were fit to
simulate data sets from R+Sel OMs. Finally, EMs 5 to 20 and 29-32 in
Table \ref{em_table} were fit to simulate data sets from R+q OMs. The
observation error variance of aggregate catch and indices were all
assumed known at the true values.

\hypertarget{measures-of-reliability}{%
\subsection*{Measures of reliability}\label{measures-of-reliability}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Measures of reliability}

The first measure of reliability we investigated was frequency of
convergence when fitting each EM to the simulated data sets. There are
various ways to assess convergence of the fit. We summarized 5
alternative categories of convergence.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Fit complete: Did the optimization routine (stats::nlminb) complete
  without error?
\item
  No flag: Did the stats::nlminb convergence flag = 0 indicate
  successful convergence?
\item
  Good gradient: Was the maximum absolute value of the gradient of the
  log-likelihood \textless{} \(1\times10^{-6}\)?
\item
  No SE NAs: Did TMB::sdreport provide non-NA values for all fixed
  effects standard errors?
\item
  No big SEs: Did TMB::sdreport provide all standard errors \textless{}
  100?
\end{enumerate}

The first convergence criterion assesses whether the model crashes. The
third is a measure that assesses how flat the likelihood is at the
optimized point of the likelihood surface. The fourth and fifth criteria
are specific to the hessian-based standard error reporting provided by
TMB. the TMB::sdreport function will sometimes return standard error
estimates even when the calculated hessian is not invertible (fourth
criterion). It will also provide large standard errors for some
parameters that are not estimated well or are near bounds on the
transformed scale that is of primary interest. For example, variance
parameters for random effects can often be estimated near 0 when the fit
suggests no variation in the random effects or, equivalently, that the
model without random effects is better. Note that Types 2 through 5 also
require type 1, and type 5 requires type 4. We used the Clopper-Pearson
exact method for constructing 95\% confidence intervals of the
probabilities of convergence (Clopper and Pearson 1934; Thulin 2014).

\hypertarget{aic-for-model-selection}{%
\subsubsection*{AIC for model selection}\label{aic-for-model-selection}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{AIC for model selection}

We estimated the probability of selection of each process error model
structure (R, R+S, R+M, R+Sel, R+q) using marginal AIC. For a given
operating model, we compared AIC for EMs that all made the same
assumptions about median/constant natural mortality (known or estimated)
and stock recruitment model (Beverton-Holt or none).

We also estimated the probability of correctly selecting between models
with Beverton-Holt stock recruit function assumed and models without the
stock-recruit function (null model). We made these comparisons between
models that otherwise assume the same process error structure as the
operating model and both of the compared models either estimate
median/constant natural mortality or assume it is known. Our preliminary
inspections of the proportions of simulations where the correct
recruitment model was chosen for a given set of OM factors indicated
generally poor performance of AIC. Furthermore, it has been shown that
estimation of stock-recruit parameters requires a wide range of SSB
(References). Therefore, we fit logistic regression models to the
indicator of Beverton-Holt models having lower AIC as a function of the
log-standard deviation of the true log(SSB) (similar to the log of the
coefficient of variation for SSB) for each simulation.

All results only condition on whether all of the compared estimating
models completed the optimization process without failure. We did not
condition on convergence as defined by a gradient threshold or
invertibity of the hessian because optimization can correctly determine
the the correct likelihood that would indicate poor convergence because
variance parameters may be at the lower bound of zero correctly for

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Bias}

We estimated bias as the median of the relative errors across all
simulations for a given OM and EM combination. \[
\text{RE}\left(\theta_i\right) = \frac{\widehat \theta_i - \theta_i}{\theta_i}
\] of annual SSB and fully-selected fishing mortality for each EM and
constructed 95\% confidence intervals for the median relative bias using
the binomial distribution approach as in Miller and Hyun (2018) and
Stock and Miller (2021). We also estimated bias of stock-recruit
parameters for EMs that assumed the Beverton-Holt stock recruit function
and the mean natural mortality rate parameter when estimated.

Similar to the AIC results, bias results only condition on whether the
estimating model completed the optimization process without failure. We
did not condition on convergence as defined by a gradient threshold or
invertibity of the hessian because the optimized model can provide
reliable estimation of SSB, F, M, and stock recruit parameters whether
or not the model was able to estimate non-zero random effects. In
practice, the model would be reconfigured to remove unnecessary process
errors and produce otherwise equivalent parameter estimates.

We estimated Mohn's \(\rho\) for SSB, fully-selected fishing mortality,
and recruitment for each EM. We estimated 7 peels for each EM. We
calculated median 95\% confidence intervals for Mohn's \(\rho\) using
the same methods as that for relative bias.

Similar to the other results, retrospective results only condition on
whether all of the peels of a given estimating model completed the
optimization process without failure. We did not condition on
convergence as defined by a gradient threshold or invertibity of the
hessian because the optimized model can provide reliable estimation of
SSB, F, M, and stock recruit parameters whether or not the model was
able to estimate non-zero random effects.

R+S EMs fit to R OMs exhibited poor convergence for types 3, 4, and 5
regardless of whether M or a stock-recruit relationship was estimated
(Figures \ref{naa_om_em_R_MF_convergence} to
\ref{naa_om_em_BH_ME_convergence}). R EMs exhibited high convergence
rates for all convergence types for both R and R+S OMs. Convergence
rates were high for all convergence types for all EMs in R+S OMs with
lower uncertainty in observations. Convergence for most convergence
types generally declines most EMs when mean-log natural mortality rate
is estimated and/or a Beverton-Holt stock recruit relationship is
estimated even when the process error assumptions of the estimation and
OMs match. There can be relatively high convergence probability of type
4 (an invertible hessian) for EMs that do not have the correct process
error assumed, but type 5 convergence (no very large standard errors
estimated from hessian) for these EMs is typically much lower.

\hypertarget{rm-operating-models}{%

R+S EMs generally converged less reliably across convergence types than
other EMs when fit to data generated from R+M OMs (Figures
\ref{M_om_em_R_MF_convergence} to \ref{M_om_em_BH_ME_convergence}).
However, using convergence type 5, all EMs converged poorly when OMs had
low variability in natural mortality process errors or higher
observation error uncertainty. Using convergence type 5, R+M EMs
generally converged better than other EMs when observation error
uncertainty was low and natural mortality process errors were more
variable. Like R+S OMs, the probability of convergence generally
declined for all EMs when mean log-natural mortality and/or a
stock-recruit relationship was estimated.

R+S EMs in particular converged poorly when R+Sel OMs had less
variability in selectivity process errors or higher observation error
uncertainty (Figures \ref{Sel_om_em_R_MF_convergence} to
\ref{Sel_om_em_BH_ME_convergence}). R+Sel EMs generally converged better
than other EMs for OMs with greater variability in process errors, lower

Convergence of R+q EMs is generally better than that of other EMs for

overFigures (\ref{q_om_em_R_MF_convergence} to
\ref{q_om_em_BH_ME_convergence}). Convergence of R+S EMs is generally
worse than that of other EMs across all OMs whether or not mean
log-natural mortality or a stock recruit relationship is estimated.
Again, convergence probablity generally declines for all EMs when mean
log-natural mortality or a stock recruit relationship is estimated.

Marginal AIC accurately determines the correct process error assumptions
in EMs when data are generated from R and R+S OMs, regardless of whether
mean log-natural mortality or a stock recruit relationship is estimated
(Figures \ref{naa_om_proportion_best_aic_R_MF} to
\ref{naa_om_proportion_best_aic_SR_ME}). Adding estimation of mean
log-natural mortality or a stock recruit relationship separately has a
negligible effect on the accuracy of determining the correct process
error assumption. When both are estimated, there is a noticeable
reduction in accuracy when OMs have a constant fishing history,
observation error is low and largest variability in recruitment process
errors.

\hypertarget{rm-operating-models-1}{%

Marginal AIC only accurately determined the correct process error model
and correlation structure when observation error was low and variability
in natural mortality process errors was high (Figures
\ref{M_om_proportion_best_aic_R_MF} to
\ref{M_om_proportion_best_aic_SR_ME}). Estimating the mean natural
mortality rate reduced the accuracy of AIC for OMs that assumed natural
mortality process errors were independent. For OMs with poor accuracy,
AIC most frequently selected EMs with process errors in catchability or
selectivity. Selection of R+S EMs was typically unlikely.

(Figures \ref{Sel_om_proportion_best_aic_R_MF} to
\ref{Sel_om_proportion_best_aic_SR_ME}). When there was low variability
in selectivity process errors and high observation error, R+q or R+S EMs
were more likely to have the best AIC. Whether mean log-natural morality

for OMs with low variability in catchability process errors and high

determined the correct source of process error (but not correlation

Our comparisons of model performance condition on assuming the true
process error configuration is known (EM and OM process error
assumptions match). Broadly, we found generally poor accuracy of AIC in
selecting models assuming a Beverton-Holt stock recruit function over
the null model without an assumed stock-recruit relationship for all OMs
(Tables \ref{naa_om_em_R_BH_aic_table} to \ref{q_om_em_R_BH_aic_table}.
However, we also found AIC to more accurately determine a stock-recruit
relationship when there was greater variation in spawning biomass
generated in the simulated populations.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{R, R+S operating models}

Among R and R+S OMs, AIC accuracy for including the B-H stock-recruit
relationship was estimated to be highest for R OMs and EMs and lowest
variance of recruitment process errors (Figures
\ref{naa_om_MF_BH_glm_AIC_plots} and \ref{naa_om_ME_BH_glm_AIC_plots}).
FOr R+S OMs and holding variability in SSB constant, accuracy of
stock-recruit model selection declined with greater variance of
recruitment and survival process errors. Simultaneously estimating mean
log-natural mortality has a small negative effect on AIC accuracy, but
there is an improvement in AIC accuracy with lower observation error in
indices and age composition and lower variation of survival process
errors.

For R+M OMs and EMs there appeared to be little effect of correlation in
the natural mortality process errors or estimating the mean log-natural
mortality on accuracy of AIC in determining a stock-recruit function,
holding variability in SSB constant (Figures
\ref{M_om_MF_BH_glm_AIC_plots} and \ref{M_om_ME_BH_glm_AIC_plots}).
However, there was an increase in accuracy with lower observation error
for OMs with higher variability in natural mortality process errors
whether the mean natural mortality rate parameter was estimated or not.

The range of variation in SSB across simulated populations was lower for
R+Sel OMs than R+S or R+M OMs. OMs with contrast in fishing pressure
over time is the primary mechanism creating variation in SSB. However,
there appears to be little effect of variability or correlation of
selectivity process errors or whether mean log-natural mortality was
estimated on the accuracy of AIC in selecting the stock recruit
relationship (Figures \ref{Sel_om_MF_BH_glm_AIC_plots} and
\ref{Sel_om_ME_BH_glm_AIC_plots}). However, there was an increase in AIC
accuracy with lower observation error for OMs with independent process
errors whether the mean natural mortality rate parameter was estimated
or not.

Like the R+Sel OMs, the range of variation in SSB across simulated
populations for R+q OMs is only increased by allowing contrast in
fishing pressure over time. There appears to be a slight decrease in
accuracy in AIC when mean log-natural mortality is estimated and there
is a more noticeable increase in accuracy for OMs with lower observation
error in those cases. (Figures \ref{q_om_MF_BH_glm_AIC_plots} and

When mean log-natural mortality is known, all estimating models
regardless of process error assumptions produce unbiased estimates of
SSB over the entire time period for R OMs (Figure
\ref{naa_om_em_R_MF_relbias_ssb}). For R+S OMs, only R+S EMs produce
unbiased estimation of SSB and bias resulting from other EMs increased
with larger variability in survival random effects. Estimating mean
log-natural mortality generally produced greater variability in relative
errors of SSB estimates and a change in sign of bias for EMs assuming
process errors other than R and R+S (Figure
\ref{naa_om_em_R_ME_relbias_ssb}). Estimating a stock-recruit
relationship had little discernable effect on bias of SSB estimation
(Figures \ref{naa_om_em_BH_MF_relbias_ssb}), but in combination with
estimating mean log-natural mortality resulted in large bias of R+S EMs
for R OMs with high observation error, constant fishing pressure and
large variability in recruitment process errors (Figure
\ref{naa_om_em_BH_ME_relbias_ssb}).

\hypertarget{rm-operating-models-3}{%
\subsubsection*{R+M operating models}\label{rm-operating-models-3}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{R+M operating models}

When mean log-natural mortality is known, SSB estimation bias was small
or non-existent for all EM process error assumptions when the OMs had
low variability of the natural mortality process errors except a
tendency toward negative bias in the terminal years for OMs with high
observation error and a change in fishing pressure over time (Figure
\ref{M_om_em_R_MF_relbias_ssb}). Errors in SSB estimation were most
variable with high variability and autocorrelation of natural mortality
process errors, but confidence intervals generally covered 0 indicating
no evidence of bias. Estimating mean log-natural mortality results in
large variability in SSB relative errors, particularly for OMs with high
observation error and constant fishing pressure and all EMs produced
biased estimation of SSB over all years when OMs had high observation
error, a change in fishing pressure and low variability of natural
mortality process errors (Figure \ref{M_om_em_R_ME_relbias_ssb}). Like R
and R+S OMs, estimating a stock-recruit relationship had little
discernible effect on SSB bias (Figures \ref{M_om_em_BH_MF_relbias_ssb}

When mean log-natural mortality is known and no stock-recruit
relationship was estimated, SSB estimation bias was low for all EM
process error assumptions (Figure \ref{Sel_om_em_R_MF_relbias_ssb}). The
worst bias occurred for OMs with uncorrelated by more variable
selectivity process errors and high observations error. As for other
OMs, estimating mean log-natural mortality resulted in greater
variability of the relative errors in SSB, but also more evidence of
bias for EMS without the correct process error assumption (Figure
\ref{Sel_om_em_R_ME_relbias_ssb}). Estimating a stock recruit
relationship resulted in greater estimation of SSB in the terminal years
and sometimes less bias when OMs had high observation error and a change
in fishing pressure over time and the effect was more pronounced when
mean log-natural mortality was estimated (Figures
\ref{Sel_om_em_BH_MF_relbias_ssb} and

When mean log-natural mortality is known and no S-R relationship was
estimated, SSB estimation bias was low for all EM process error
assumptions for all R+q OMs with low variability in catchability process
errors (Figure \ref{q_om_em_R_MF_relbias_ssb}). With larger variability
in catchability process errors, bias was low for all EMs except those
configured with R+M process errors and OMs assumed low observation
error. Many EMs also showed some negative bias for terminal SSB in OMs
with higher observation error and a change in fishing pressure over
time. As for other OMs, mean log-natural mortality resulted in greater
variablity of the relative errors in SSB, but also more evidence of bias
for some EMs without the correct process error assumption (Figure
\ref{q_om_em_R_ME_relbias_ssb}) Estimating a stock recruit relationship
resulted in less bias in SSB in terminal years when OMs had high
observation error and a change in fishing pressure over time (Figures

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Beverton-Holt parameter estimation}

In R and R+S OMs, EMs with the correct assumptions about process errors,
provided the least biased estimation of Beverton-Holt stock-recruit
relationship parameters when there was low observation error, a change
in fishing pressure over time, and lower variability of recruitment
process errors, and higher variability survival process errors, and
there was little effect of estimating natural mortality (Figure
\ref{naa_om_SR_relbias}). For other R and R+S OMs, estimating natural
mortality often resulted in less biased estimation of stock-recruit
parameters. The range of confidence intervals for the median parameter
bias suggests large variability of the parameter estimates.

In R+M OMs, the most accurate estimation of stock-recruit parameters
occurred when there was a change in fishing pressure combined with
either low variability in natural mortality process errors and high
observation error or vice versa (Figure \ref{M_om_SR_relbias}). Relative
to the R, and R+S OMs, there was even less effect of estimating mean
log-natural mortality on estimation bias for the stock- recruit
relationship parameters, but similarly there was generally large
variability of the parameter estimates.

In R+Sel OMs, bias for stock-recruit parameters was very large for OMs
with constant fishing pressure (Figure \ref{Sel_om_SR_relbias}). Less
bias in parameter estimation occurred for OMs with a change in fishing
pressure over time. There was little effect of estimating natural
mortality. Patterns in bias of stock-recruit parameter estimation in R+q
OMs, were very similar to those in R+Sel OMs with poor estimation of
these parameters in OMs with constant fishing pressure (Figure
\ref{q_om_SR_relbias}). Like other OMs, there was generally large
variability of the parameter estimates.

The mean natural mortality rate is estimated pretty accurately for R and
R+S OMs when EMs use the correct process error configuration and there
is a change in fishing pressure over time and observation error is low
(Figure \ref{naa_om_M_relbias}). Estimation is a little more variable
when observation error is higher or fishing pressure is constant, but
when OMs have both, estimation is extremely variable. There is little
effect of estimating stock-recruit relationships on the bias in
estimating natural mortality. For R+M OMs, effects on estimating mean
log-natural mortality were similar to the R and R+S OMs: best estimation
with a change in fishing pressure and low observation error and worst
with no change in fishing pressure and higher observation error (Figure
\ref{M_om_M_relbias}). The same patterns also occurred for R+Sel and R+q
OMs (Figures \ref{Sel_om_M_relbias} and \ref{q_om_M_relbias}).

\hypertarget{convergence}{%
\subsection*{Convergence}\label{convergence}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Convergence}

Convergence results can be useful for understanding how bad convergence
in applications to real data might direct the practitioner to which
alternative random effects configurations is be more appropriate.
Therefore, the type of convergence that we might use as a diagnostic is
important. It is common during assessment model fitting to check that
the maximum absolute gradient component is less than some threshold. Our
Type 3 convergence represents this and we used 1e-6 as the threshold,
but there is no standard. Furthermore we found the hessian at the
optimized log-likelihood can often be invertible (Convergence types 4
and 5) when the gradient approach to convergence fails. The probability
of convergence type 5 cannot be greater than that of type 4 because type
5 is a subset where none of the standard errors obtained by inverting
the hessian are greater than a specified value (100 in this case). We
presume that the parameters that cause type 4 convergence to fail will
also typically be the same as those that cause type 5 to fail. Perhaps a
higher gradient threshold for Type 3 convergence would be more
consistent with hessian-based convergence, but the gradient and
hessian-based standard errors should be inspected. Parameters that are
not well estimated can lead the assessment scientist toward a more
appropriate and often more parsimonious model configuration. For
example, variance parameters that are estimated on log scale as low
negative number (variance is close to 0) can happen for random effects
estimated with little or no variability. These may sometimes lead a
hessian to not be invertible or due to numerical issues may be
invertible, but provide very large standard errors. More generally, we
can expect lower likelihood of convergence when estimating natural
mortality or stock-recruit relationships because the typical data in
assessment models does not strongly inform these parameters.

\hypertarget{aic}{%
\subsection*{AIC}\label{aic}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{AIC}

Among the process error configurations we used in OMs, we found AIC to
be accurate for process errors on recruitment and survival. Fitting
models to other OMs rarely preferred R+S EMs and R and R+S EMs were
nearly always selected for the matching OMs. For other sources of
process error, accuracy of AIC was improved to useful levels when there
was larger variability in the process errors and/or lower observation
error. Therefore, when data are relatively good and an there is large
variability in the unknown process errors, AIC is likely to perform
well.

AIC generally performs weakly in determining stock recruit relationships
unless there is large contrast in SSB. Interestingly, Miller et al.
(2016) found AIC to prefer a stock-recruit relationship for SNEMA
yellowtail flounder where there was a large change in stock size
estimated over time and flatfish are well observed by the bottom trawl
indices relative to some other guilds such as semi-pelagic species.
Although we did not compare models with alternative stock-recruit
relationships, we do not expect AIC to perform any better distinguishing
these relationships. Our results comport well with those of de Valpine
and Hastings (2002) where state-space stock-recruit models were fit just
to SSB and recruitment ``observations''.

\hypertarget{bias-2}{%
\subsection*{Bias}\label{bias-2}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Bias}

As we might expect bias in all parameters and assessment output was
generally less with lower observation error in indices and age
composition. Reliable estimation of stock-recruit relationship
parameters only appears possible in ideal situations with lower
observation errors in age composition and indices, lower variability in
recruitment process errors and large contrast in spawning biomass over
time. The latter can occur in with larger variability in survival or
natural mortality process errors, variation in fishing pressure.

Estimation of natural mortality (or the mean when there are process
errors on natural mortality) appears more feasible. We found low or no
evidence of bias for many OM process error assumptions when there was
contrast in fishing pressure even when there was greater observation
error although it can lead to more variable estimates of natural
mortality. For OMs where there was bias in natural mortality due to high
observation error (R+Sel, R+q), estimating the stock-recruit
relationship seemed to remove the bias. However, estimation of natural
mortality can cause large differences between the true and estimated SSB
(that may be unbiased on average) when there is less contrast in fishing
pressure over time and higher observation error.

\hypertarget{retrospective-patterns}{%
\subsection*{Retrospective patterns}\label{retrospective-patterns}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Retrospective patterns}

Higher observation error with variation in fishing pressure can produce
retrospective patterns even when the the process error assumption is
correct, but this retrospective pattern can be reduced if M or the
correct stock recruit relationship is estimated. Retrospective patterns
tended to be more variable for recruitment and can be large even when
the EM is correct. Therefore, we recommend emphasis on inspection of
retrospective patterns primarily for SSB and F, but further research on
retrospective patterns in other assessment model parameters and derived
output may be beneficial.

\subsection*{Summary}\label{summary}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Summary}

We conducted a simulation study where we simulated process errors and
observations for 72 operating models with alternative assumptions about
fishing history, degree of uncertainty in index and age composition
observations, type (recruitment, survival, fishery selectivity,
catchability and natural mortality), degree of variation, and
correlation of process errors. We fit 20 different estimation models to
each of 100 simulated set of observations with alternative assumptions
type and correlation structure of process errors, (mean) natural
mortality was known or estimated, and a B-H stock recruit relationship
was assumed or not.

Across simulations we summarized probability of convergence of fitted
models, accuracy of marginal AIC in determining the correct process
error assumption and it ability to determine the Beverton-Holt stock
recruit relationship, bias in annual spawning stock biomass, in
estimation of natural mortality, and in stock-recruit relationship
parameters, and severity of retrospective patterns for estimation
models.

Alternative measures of convergence performed differently. Invertible
hessians and resulting standard error estimation was possible when
criteria based on the gradient of the optimized log-likelihood with
respect to the fixed effects parameters. Using hessian-based
convergence, probability of convergence was best for models that assumed
the correct source of process error, assumed M was known, and did not
assume stock-recruit relationships.

Using marginal AIC provided most accurate inferences about the process
errors on recruitment and survival and selectivity, in that AIC
preferred EMs with assumed process errors that matched OMs, and EMs with
those assumed process errors were not preferred when alternative process
errors were assumed in the OMs. However, when the true process errors
were more variable, AIC accuracy increased to a useful level. We found
AIC more accurately determined a B-H stock recruit relationship rather
than the null model without a S-R relationship when there was low
variability in recruitment, low variability in survival random effects,
and higher variation in spawning biomass over the time series. When the
(mean) natural mortality rate was estimated, we found large bias and
uncertainty much more likely in model output such as spawning stock
biomass.

Bias in spawning stock biomass estimation was generally low for
estimation models that assumed the correct source of process error when
there was lower observation error. Reliable estimation of stock-recruit
relationship parameters only appears possible in ideal situations with
lower observation errors in age composition and indices, lower
variability in recruitment process errors and large contrast in spawning
biomass over time. We found little evidence of bias for many OM process
error assumptions when there was contrast in fishing pressure even when
there was greater observation error although it can lead to more
variable estimates of natural mortality. For OMs where there was bias in
natural mortality due to high observation error, estimation the
stock-recruit relationship seemed to remove the bias. However,
estimation of natural mortality can cause large differences between the
true and estimated SSB (that may be unbiased on average) when there is
less contrast in fishing pressure over time and higher observation
error.

Retrospective patterns were generally weak for all estimation models
regardless of the true source of process error, but they can be expected
for recruitment even for the correct process error assumptions when
observation error is high. When models did exhibit some retrospective
pattern, estimation the mean natural mortality rate tended to remove it.
